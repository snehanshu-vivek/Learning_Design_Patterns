# Creational Design Patterns:

Creational design patterns  **focus on object creation mechanisms** , aiming to **increase flexibility and reuse** by decoupling the instantiation process from the actual implementation. Instead of directly creating objects using the `new` keyword, these patterns provide various techniques to  **control and optimize object creation** .


## Types of Creational Design Patterns:

1) **Singleton** : Ensures that only one instance of a class exists and provides a global access point to it.
2) **Prototype** : Creates new objects by cloning an existing object.
3) **Builder** : Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation.
4) **Factory** : Provides an interface for creating objects , but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
5) **Abstract Factory** : Provides an interface for creating families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
