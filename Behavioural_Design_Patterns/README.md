# Behavioural Design Patterns:

Behavioral design patterns  **focus on communication between objects** —how they interact and distribute responsibilities. These patterns help in managing complex control flows, event handling, and object collaboration while promoting **loose coupling** and  **flexibility** .


## Types of Behavioural Design Patterns:

1) **Chain of Responsibility** : Passes a request along a chain of handlers until it's handled.
2) **Command** : Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing undo/redo functionality.
3) **Interpreter** : Implements a language grammar and interpreter for specific operations.
4) **Iterator** : Provides a way to access elements of a collection  without exposing its structure.
5) **Mediator** : Centralizes communication between objects to reduce dependencies.
6) **Momento** : Captures an object’s state so it can be restored later (undo/rollback).
7) **Observer** : Defines a one-to-many dependency so that observers get notified of changes.
8) **State** : Allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes.
9) **Strategy** : Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates them, and makes them interchangeable.
10) **Template Method** : Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class but lets subclasses modify parts.
11) **Visitor** : Separates algorithms from the objects they operate on.
