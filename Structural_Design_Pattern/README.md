# Structural Design Patterns:

**Structural design patterns** deal with the **composition of classes and objects** to form **larger, more complex structures** while ensuring that the system remains  **flexible and efficient** . They focus on how **objects are related** and how they can be **combined** to achieve functionality.


## Types of Structural Design Patterns:

1) **Adapter** : Converts one interface into another that a client expects, allowing incompatible interfaces to work together.
2) **Bridge** : Decouples abstraction from implementation so they can change independently.
3) **Composite** : Treats individual objects and groups of objects uniformly as part of a hierarchy.
4) **Decorator** : Adds functionality to an object dynamically without modifying its structure.
5) **Facade** : Provides a simplified interface to a complex system.
6) **Flyweight** : Minimizes memory usage by sharing common data between objects instead of storing duplicate information.
7) **Proxy** : Controls access to another object by acting as an intermediary. Can add security, lazy loading, caching, etc.
