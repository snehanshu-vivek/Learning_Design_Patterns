# Design Patterns 
Design Patterns are proven solutions to common software design problems. 
They provide reusable templates for solving specific challenges in software development.

Design patterns help in:
- Writing maintainable, scalable, and efficient code
- Reducing code duplication and improving reusability
- Standardizing best practices across different projects
- Making code more flexible and easier to modify

They are not direct implementations but guidelines that developers follow based on the problem at hand.

## Design Patterns are categorised into three categories:
1) Creational Design Pattern : Focus on how objects are created, instantiated, and managed.
2) Structural Design Pattern : Focus on how objects and classes are structured and related to form larger structures.
3) Behavioural Design Pattern : Define how objects interact and communicate with each other.
